	  			Itâ€™s amazing what people can do with just a little bit of information. When people are told only part of what they want to know, their ability to guess and rationalize the rest is truly incredible.
<br><br>
If you have ever seen a movie or read a book, you realized that the world that is shown in the story is not quite the whole world the characters live in. They might have a backstory or friends who never appear in the story. These all have a large impact on how the character acts. They define who the character is.
<br><br>
I would love to examine this subject in an academic setting. I want to see how others see certain worlds, how other make connections I just cannot see. When two people look at the same thing and see entirely different things is a wonderful feeling. Finding how we think differently can help almost anyone, and seeing how we view fictional worlds differently is a wonderful way to start.
