			When worlds are different from our own, the assumptions we make initially are often skewed. 
<br><br>
In the Fallout series, you begin as a character around 200 years after a global nuclear apocalypse. A large part of this game is deciding who you are. Sometimes you pick a character who you think you would be in a postapocalyptic setting. Sometimes you pick a character the opposite of you. Unsurprisingly, the decisions you make regarding your character can change how you see the game. So in a more overt sense, different people can get a different feel from the world. Discussing the choices made about Fallout characters can show what different students thought the world should look like as much as what they found inside the game itself.

<br><br>
Quickly you get released into an open world for you to explore. Now you can explore the main story to see what happens, but by running around randomly you can still find things to do. You find people with stories of woe or stories of happiness and you get to decide if and how you want to help them. Who you help matters as you explore the world. The game remembers and word gets around surprisingly fast sometimes.
<br><br>
While this type of video game is a bit more varied than a linear story, it still can bring stimulating discussion about how different people see the world in the game. Though the story might be changed by the choices players make in the world more than the world itself, the world would still have a large impact on how people feel.
